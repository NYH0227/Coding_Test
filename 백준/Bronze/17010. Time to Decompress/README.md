### 문제 설명

<p>You and your friend have come up with a way to send messages back and forth.</p>

<p>Your friend can encode a message to you by writing down a positive integer N and a symbol. You can decode that message by writing out that symbol N times in a row on one line.</p>

<p>Given a message that your friend has encoded, decode it.</p>

### 입력 

 <p>The first line of input contains L, the number of lines in the message.</p>

<p>The next L lines each contain one positive integer less than 80, followed by one space, followed by a (non-space) character.</p>

### 출력 

 <p>The output should be L lines long. Each line should contain the decoding of the corresponding line of the input. Specifically, if line i+1 of the input contained N x, then line i of the output should contain just the character x printed N times.</p>
